# KafkaRestClient
This is an implementation demonstrating the use of an Apache Kafka cluster with the Titanium API. Since REST for this mobile client is required, the Confluent Kafka-rest application works out great here. The free application Kafka Rest Client based on this open source code, will be availble for Android really soon, and iOS to follow.

See:

for the actual client REST implementation
